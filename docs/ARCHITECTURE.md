# Architecture

The upstream Harness product is a Rust workspace with two independent binaries.
`crates/harness/` is the default core-maintenance CLI. `crates/harness-cli/` is
the optional SQLite compatibility control plane. Schema migrations live in
`scripts/schema/`, while installers and release workflows form the distribution
boundary.

The core-maintenance crate enforces this dependency direction:

```text
domain <- application <- infrastructure
                    <- interface
main.rs composes interface and infrastructure
```

Domain types contain paths, provenance, merge results, and reports without
filesystem, process, serialization, or CLI dependencies. Application use cases
depend on ports. Infrastructure implements embedded release content, hashing,
locking, filesystem transactions, and Git-backed three-way merge. The interface
only parses commands and renders results. Architecture tests reject outward
imports from inner layers.

Consumer provenance lives in `.harness-core/manifest.json` plus the exact
upstream bytes under `.harness-core/base/`. An update stages its full result,
writes a durable transaction journal, backs up prior bytes, activates workspace
files, and commits provenance last. A later mutating command rolls back an
interrupted apply before starting new work.

The reusable template does not select an application stack for a consumer
project. The discovery guidance below is for that consumer application after a
user-provided spec and stack decision exist; it does not describe the upstream
Harness CLI as unimplemented.

The optional compatibility control plane has three state forms: a tracked
read-only baseline at `.harness/core-state/`, tracked typed JSONL deltas at
`.harness/changesets/`, and one ignored writable `harness.db` per checkout or
worktree. When that surface is explicitly used, bootstrap verifies baseline
identity, replays only post-baseline deltas, and activates the local database
atomically. Installed consumers keep their databases local and do not inherit
the upstream baseline. The default repository workflow requires none of this
state.

## Discovery Before Shape

Before proposing implementation shape, identify:

- Product surfaces: browser, mobile, desktop, CLI, API, worker, or service.
- Runtime stack: language, framework, database, queues, providers, and hosting.
- Core domains: the product concepts that deserve stable names and contracts.
- Boundary inputs: user input, API requests, webhooks, jobs, files, credentials,
  provider payloads, and environment configuration.
- Validation ladder: the smallest checks that can prove the selected stack.

Record stack choices in `docs/decisions/` when they meaningfully constrain
future work.

## Default Layering

```text
domain
  <- application
      <- infrastructure
          <- interface
              <- app surfaces
```

## Consumer Candidate Structure

```text
app/
  domain/
    entities/
    value-objects/
    repositories/
    services/

  application/
    commands/
    queries/
    handlers/

  infrastructure/
    database/
    logging/
    notifications/

  interface/
    controllers/
    dto/
    presenters/
    routes/
    middlewares/

surfaces/
  browser/
  mobile/
  desktop/
  cli/
```

This is a thinking template, not a scaffold. Create real folders only when an
accepted change enters implementation and the selected stack needs them.

## Dependency Rule

Inner layers must not depend on outer layers.

| Layer | May depend on | Must not depend on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| domain | nothing project-external except tiny pure utilities | framework, database, UI, provider, process/env |
| application | domain | framework, UI, provider, database concrete clients |
| infrastructure | domain, application | interface controllers or UI |
| interface | all backend layers | UI state or platform shell assumptions |
| app surfaces | API contracts and app-facing clients | domain internals directly |

## Parse-First Boundary Rule

Unknown data must be parsed at boundaries before it enters inner code.

Boundaries include:

- HTTP request bodies, params, and query strings.
- Session payloads and identity claims.
- Environment variables.
- Database rows returned from external clients.
- Platform shell payloads.
- Deep links, tokens, and signed URLs.
- Provider webhooks, events, and async payloads.

Target flow:

```text
unknown input
  -> parser
  -> typed DTO or command
  -> application use case
  -> domain object/value object
```

Inner layers should work with meaningful product types such as `UserId`,
`AccountId`, `WorkspaceId`, `Role`, `DateRange`, or domain-specific IDs,
rather than repeatedly validating raw strings.

## Command/Query Boundary

If the product has both reads and writes, keep command/query separation clear at
the code level even when the storage layer is simple:

- Commands mutate state and own audit side effects.
- Queries read state and format for consumers.
- Shared domain rules live in domain/application, not controllers.

## Observability Contract

The future server should emit one canonical JSON log line per request with:

- timestamp
- level
- request_id
- user_id when known
- action
- duration_ms
- status_code
- message

Audit logs are product records. Application logs are operational records. Do not
use one as a substitute for the other.
