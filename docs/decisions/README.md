# Decisions

Decision records preserve lasting product, architecture, data ownership,
security, compatibility, and validation choices that future work must inherit.

Use `docs/templates/decision.md`. Task-local implementation choices remain in
the active execution plan and do not require a separate decision.

An installed consumer begins with no fabricated decisions. Add local decision
documents here as real choices are accepted, then index them in this file.

## Upstream Current Decisions

These source-repository decisions explain Harness itself; they are not installed
consumer product choices.

## Compatibility Decisions

These decisions remain relevant only when maintaining the optional CLI,
SQLite, or orchestration surface.

## Historical Decisions

These records explain superseded default behavior and remain available for
provenance rather than current instruction.

| [0009](https://github.com/hoangnb24/repository-harness/blob/main/docs/decisions/0009-separate-symphony-product-repository.md) | Completed migration | Separate Symphony Into Its Own Product Repository |

## Add A Decision When

- A locked technical choice changes.
- Product behavior changes meaningfully and alternatives have different
  consequences.
- Data ownership, authorization, privacy, security, or public compatibility is
  decided.
- A validation requirement is added, removed, or weakened.
- The source-of-truth hierarchy or default workflow changes.

Do not add a decision merely because a task mentions a sensitive domain or uses
a durable execution plan.
