# Completed Execution Plans

Move a plan here only after its requested outcome and validation are recorded.
Completed plans are historical evidence, not default task instructions.

Keep a completed plan when it explains a consequential migration, recovery
procedure, architectural transition, or decision history that future work may
need. Ordinary bounded changes should rely on Git and pull-request history
instead of creating permanent plan documents.

## Retained Plans

- `phase-1-workflow-decoupling.md`: replaced the mandatory database-centered
  lifecycle with the repository-centered default workflow while preserving the
  prior control plane as a compatibility surface.
- `phase-2-knowledge-boundary-and-payload-reduction.md`: made the default
  installation a ten-file repository-centered core and moved the complete CLI,
  SQLite, and orchestration surface behind explicit compatibility selection.
