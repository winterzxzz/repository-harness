# Symphony Web UI Controller

## Purpose

The Symphony Web UI Controller gives non-technical users a local browser surface
for controlling Harness Symphony tasks without needing to operate the CLI
directly.

The UI is a controller for existing Harness and Symphony concepts. It should not
become a second task runner, a second feature intake system, or a separate source
of truth.

## Users

- Non-technical task owners who need to start, watch, review, and approve
  Symphony work.
- Technical maintainers who need to inspect run details, logs, validation
  evidence, PR state, and sync state from the same surface.

## Product Principles

- Use simple user-facing labels. Avoid exposing Harness terms unless a detail
  panel needs them.
- Present run communication as readable conversation and progress summaries
  first, while keeping raw artifacts available for technical review.
- Keep all tasks visible, but block unsafe actions when dependencies or active
  run rules prevent work from starting.
- Let users remove unwanted unstarted work from the active board without
  destroying durable Harness history.
- Make hierarchy explicit so users can understand how feature intake breaks a
  larger request into executable work.
- Keep the MVP local-only and unauthenticated.
- Allow only one active task at a time in the MVP.
- Preserve the existing Symphony workflow: run workspace, Codex App Server
  adapter, result artifacts, PR review, merged PR, and sync.

## Task Source

Tasks come from Harness stories created during feature intake or from an
explicit Guided Intake create action in the local Web UI.

Feature intake is responsible for producing:

- Task hierarchy.
- Task dependencies.
- Runnable task boundaries.
- Validation expectations.

The Web UI must not silently create tasks. It may create a Harness story only
after the user explicitly confirms the Guided Intake draft.

## Guided Intake

The Web UI may help users shape a rough idea into a story draft before durable
records exist. The draft surface stays advisory until the user explicitly
confirms creation.

The draft surface may collect:

- rough idea
- affected operator or audience
- desired outcome
- non-goals
- validation proof
- suggested lane

The confirmed create action writes one intake row and one planned story row.
The story should include the validation proof as its verify command so it can
appear as Ready when it has no blockers. Creation must not mutate dependencies,
start Symphony, create a run, create a PR, or sync changes. Durable Harness
records remain the source of truth after creation.

## Board Card Presentation

Board cards are summaries, not the full work-item record. The board must stay
scannable across four user-facing buckets, so each card should keep long titles,
reasons, run IDs, blocker metadata, failure labels, internal status, and action
hints bounded inside the column.

The board must not create horizontal scrolling inside a column or inside a
card. Dense task lists may scroll vertically within a column. Full work-item
content belongs in the task detail popup or review surfaces.

Board cards must remain readable while they are bounded. Dense columns may use
compact cards, but a card should still expose its story ID, status or verify
badge, readable title summary, and key metadata. A column with many tasks must
not compress cards into clipped strips where most of the summary content is
hidden.

## Dependency Model

Dependencies live in Harness because they are produced during feature intake.

A task dependency means one task cannot move into `In Progress` until every
blocking task is `Done`.

The dependency graph must support:

- Listing direct blockers for a task.
- Listing tasks unblocked by a completed task.
- Deriving `Ready` and `Blocked` status.
- Detecting cycles before tasks are presented as runnable.
- Explaining why a blocked task is blocked in simple language.

Cycle detection is required. A cycle is a product planning error and should be
shown as a task breakdown problem, not as a user action problem.

## Board Buckets And States

The primary board buckets are:

| Bucket | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Drafts | Unstarted work that may be runnable or still blocked by planning/dependencies. |
| Active | Work currently running or requiring operator attention before it can move forward. |
| Ready | Finished agent work waiting for review, PR merge, or local sync approval. |
| Done | Accepted work whose PR/sync flow is complete. |

Internal Symphony task states remain the source of truth. The board groups them
into buckets and keeps the specific state visible in cards, detail panels, and
review/failure surfaces.

The internal task states are:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | The task has no incomplete blockers and can be selected. |
| Blocked | The task has incomplete blockers or a dependency cycle. |
| In Progress | The user selected the task and Symphony is running it. |
| Review | A run completed, `RESULT.json` exists, and either a PR has been created or PR creation is disabled for local artifact review. |
| Needs Attention | A run failed, was interrupted, or cannot create required review artifacts. |
| Done | The PR was merged and Symphony sync applied the accepted changeset. |

Bucket mapping:

- `Ready` state appears in Drafts because the work has not started yet.
- `Blocked`, `In Progress`, and `Needs Attention` appear in Active because they
  need current operator or runner attention.
- `Review` appears in Ready because agent work is ready for human review/sync.
- `Done` appears in Done.

## Main Workflow

1. User opens the local Web UI.
2. UI shows task hierarchy and board buckets.
3. User clicks a task and inspects the floating task detail popup without
   losing the board context.
4. User starts a `Ready` task from the popup or from the guarded `Run with
   Codex` action on a Ready board card.
5. The task moves to `In Progress`.
6. Entering `In Progress` starts execution like `harness-symphony run`.
7. UI shows live Codex App Server events for the active run.
8. Codex App Server task execution is not capped by a fixed wall-clock timeout;
   it continues until Codex reports a terminal turn, the app-server process
   exits, an explicit cancellation path is added, a protocol stall guard fires,
   or required result validation fails.
9. When Codex emits `turn/completed` with completed status and required
   artifacts validate, Symphony creates a PR when PR creation is enabled.
10. The task moves to `Review` and appears in the Ready bucket.
11. User reviews summary, result, changeset, validation evidence, PR status, and
   logs.
12. After the PR is merged, or after local artifact review when PR creation is
   disabled, the user approves sync from the UI.
13. UI runs Symphony sync.
14. The task moves to `Done`.

## Ready Task Removal

The task detail popup may show a delete action only for tasks in `Ready` state.
This action removes unwanted unstarted work from the active board by retiring
the Harness story. It must not hard-delete the story row, run artifacts,
changesets, dependencies, hierarchy records, or validation history.

Delete must be explicit and guarded:

- The UI asks for confirmation before retiring the task.
- The backend re-checks that the task is still `Ready` before applying the
  transition.
- Tasks in `Blocked`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Needs Attention`, or `Done`
  cannot be deleted from the Web UI.
- Retired tasks are not runnable and should not appear as active Ready work.

## Failure Workflow

If Codex fails, the run is interrupted, required artifacts are missing, PR
creation fails, or validation fails, the task moves to `Needs Attention`.

`Needs Attention` must show:

- What failed.
- The last observed Codex event or error.
- Links to run artifacts when present.
- Suggested next action.
- Retry controls when retry is safe.

The primary board/detail surface must not stop at a generic `Needs Attention`
label. It should show a concise failure reason and a path to the evidence that
explains the transition, such as `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl`, `SUMMARY.md`,
`RESULT.json`, PR creation output, or validation output. A technical maintainer
should be able to tell whether the issue is a Codex protocol/runtime problem,
missing artifact, PR/review problem, validation failure, or manual follow-up
without leaving the controller first.

Recovery from `Needs Attention` must be explicit and guarded:

- Retryable execution failures can start a new run for the same story after the
  user confirms the retry.
- PR creation failures retry PR creation for the completed run instead of
  starting the agent again.
- Recovery never rewrites a failed run into a successful run; old run evidence
  remains available.
- The backend decides whether recovery is allowed from story status, latest run
  status, PR state, sync state, and the active-run lock.
- Recovery is refused when another run is active, the story is no longer
  runnable, or the task is already in `Review` or `Done`.

## Ready Run Action

Ready board cards may expose a direct `Run with Codex` action for faster
execution. The action is a convenience for the existing start endpoint, not a
separate runner.

The direct run action must be explicit and guarded:

- It asks for confirmation before starting Symphony.
- It is available only on `Ready` work with configured proof.
- It is disabled while another run is active.
- It starts the existing Symphony workflow through `/api/tasks/<story-id>/start`.
- It must not bypass the active-run lock, dependency checks, review flow, PR
  creation rules, merge gate, or sync approval.

## Request Changes From Ready

Ready work is completed agent output awaiting human acceptance. When the result
does not satisfy the user, the task detail review surface must support
`Request changes` without creating another story or adding another board bucket.

The request-changes flow must:

- Require a trimmed textual reason from 1 to 2,000 characters.
- Accept up to three optional PNG, JPEG, or WebP evidence images, with a 5 MB
  limit per file.
- Validate the complete reason and upload before changing run state or starting
  another agent.
- Preserve the completed source run, its artifacts, logs, PR state, and result.
- Prepare a replacement run for the same story, store the feedback under that
  run's local artifact directory, and include feedback paths in the run contract
  and agent prompt.
- Mark the source run rejected only after replacement preparation succeeds.
- Move the board item directly from Ready to Active while the replacement run
  executes, then return it to Ready for another human decision.
- Refuse Done tasks, non-current Ready runs, non-runnable stories, unsupported or
  oversized files, and requests while another run is active.

Feedback artifacts are local runtime evidence and must not be committed to Git.
They follow `.harness/runs/<run_id>/` retention and compaction. The server must
generate safe evidence filenames and validate image signatures instead of
trusting browser filenames or MIME declarations.

## Review Surface

The review screen should expose enough information for the user to make an
approval decision without leaving the Web UI.

It should include:

- Task summary.
- Run outcome from `RESULT.json`.
- Validation evidence.
- Changed files.
- Human-readable changeset preview.
- PR link and merge status, or local artifact-review status when PR creation is
  disabled.
- Codex event log.
- Human-readable chat and progress log derived from Codex events.
- Run summary.
- Approve/sync action after the PR is merged, or after local artifact review
  when PR creation is disabled.
- Request-changes action with feedback reason and optional image evidence while
  the task is Ready.
- Retry or mark-needs-attention actions when review artifacts are incomplete.

Raw artifacts should remain accessible from the review surface.

## Controller Design Principles

The Web UI is a dense product controller for repeated operational work, not a
marketing surface. It should prioritize scanability, stable controls, explicit
state, and low-friction review over decorative composition.

Local shadcn-style primitives are the default foundation for application
controls and framed UI. Product-specific components should be extracted when a
pattern repeats or when reuse prevents drift in board cards, detail popups,
status tones, review panels, or log surfaces.

Design validation should combine deterministic product proof with human visual
review. Build and Playwright checks prove the UI works; desktop/mobile
screenshots prove the layout fits; Impeccable or equivalent tooling can provide
design vocabulary, anti-pattern detection, audit, and polish feedback when the
tool is installed.

## Codex Event Source

The existing Symphony Codex adapter writes Codex App Server JSON-RPC events to:

```text
.harness/runs/<run_id>/APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl
```

The Web UI should stream or tail this file for the active run.

Useful event types include:

- `thread/started`
- `turn/started`
- `item/agentMessage/delta`
- `item/completed`
- `turn/diff/updated`
- `thread/status/changed`
- `turn/completed`

`turn/completed` with completed status is required before moving to `Review`.

## Local Web Boundary

The MVP should be local-only and no-auth.

The expected control surface is:

```text
harness-symphony web
```

After the loopback listener binds, browser mode must open the controller URL
in the system default browser. Headless and automated callers must be able to
disable this convenience with `harness-symphony web --no-open`. Failure to open
the browser must warn without stopping the local server because the printed
URL remains a valid manual recovery path.

The backend should expose local APIs for board data, task details, run start,
event streaming, review state, PR status, and sync.

The frontend should use Vite, React, and shadcn components.

## Desktop Boundary

The desktop app is a packaged shell around the same local Web UI controller. It
starts a loopback `harness-symphony web` backend, loads the existing React UI,
and keeps the existing `/api/*` routes as the contract between renderer and
backend.

The desktop shell must not fork task execution, durable state, review behavior,
or sync behavior. Rebuilding the desktop app should include the latest Web UI
build output and the current `harness-symphony` backend binary.

## Non-Goals

- User authentication.
- Hosted team deployment.
- Multiple active tasks.
- Task creation from the Web UI.
- External issue tracker adapters.
- Replacing Harness feature intake.
- Replacing Symphony run isolation.
- Desktop signing, notarization, auto-update, and installer distribution for
  the first desktop MVP.

## MVP Implementation Decisions

- Dependency edges are stored in Harness `story_dependency` records.
- Task hierarchy is stored in Harness `story_hierarchy` records.
- PR merge status is entered manually for the MVP through the local Web UI.
- Codex events are exposed as a polling tail snapshot from
  `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl` through the local Web API.
- The primary UI should summarize Codex events into readable chat/progress
  entries; raw `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl` remains available for debugging.
- Ready task deletion is a lifecycle transition to Harness story status
  `retired`, not a physical delete.

## Validation Expectations

Implementation stories should include proof for:

- Dependency graph ready/blocked derivation.
- Dependency cycle detection.
- Single-active-task enforcement.
- `Ready` to `In Progress` transition.
- Codex App Server execution without a fixed wall-clock timeout.
- Codex event streaming from `APP_SERVER_EVENTS.jsonl`.
- `turn/completed` plus valid `RESULT.json` transition to `Review`.
- Failed run transition to `Needs Attention`.
- Needs Attention explanation, artifact links, and suggested next action.
- Needs Attention recovery controls: retryable execution failure starts a new
  run, PR failure retries PR creation, and non-recoverable states are refused
  with clear errors.
- PR merged plus sync transition to `Done`.
- Browser UI flow through Playwright or equivalent.
- Ready task deletion guardrails: visible only for Ready tasks, confirmation
  required, backend refuses non-Ready tasks, and retired tasks disappear from
  active Ready work.
