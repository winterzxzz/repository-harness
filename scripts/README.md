## Harness CLI

The Rust Harness CLI is the primary interface for the durable layer. Installed
projects use the prebuilt binary at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows for normal Harness work.

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli init          # Create the database
scripts/bin/harness-cli intake ...    # Record a feature intake classification
scripts/bin/harness-cli story ...     # Add or update a story (test matrix row)
scripts/bin/harness-cli story update --id US-001 --unit 1 --integration 1 --e2e 0 --platform 0
scripts/bin/harness-cli story verify US-001  # Run the story's verify_command
scripts/bin/harness-cli decision ...  # Add a decision or run its verification
scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog ...   # Add or close a backlog item
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace ...     # Record and auto-score an agent execution trace
scripts/bin/harness-cli score-trace   # Score a trace against TRACE_SPEC.md tiers
scripts/bin/harness-cli query ...     # Query harness data, including backlog --open/--closed
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix --numeric  # Show proof flags as 1/0
scripts/bin/harness-cli db changeset apply .harness/changesets/run_123.changeset.jsonl
scripts/bin/harness-cli db rebuild --from .harness/changesets
scripts/bin/harness-cli migrate       # Apply pending schema migrations
scripts/bin/harness-cli --version     # Print the installed CLI version
```

Run `scripts/bin/harness-cli help` or `scripts/bin/harness-cli query help` for
full usage. On Windows, use the same commands through
`.\scripts\bin\harness-cli.exe`.

Proof flags on `story update` are numeric booleans: use `1` for yes and `0` for
no. `story verify <id>` runs the configured `verify_command`; it does not accept
proof flags. Configure the command with `story add/update --verify`, run
`story verify <id>`, then update proof flags with `story update`.

Backlog `--risk` uses Harness lanes, not severity words: use `tiny`, `normal`,
or `high-risk`. Use `tiny` instead of `low`. `query matrix` defaults to
human-readable `yes`/`no`; use `query matrix --numeric` when copying values into
`story update`.

The schema lives in `scripts/schema/` and is version-controlled. The database
file (`harness.db`) is `.gitignore`d.

Set `HARNESS_DB_PATH=/path/to/harness.db` when a workflow needs `harness-cli`
to operate on an isolated copied database. `HARNESS_DB_PATH` takes precedence
over the legacy `HARNESS_DB` override; if neither is set, the CLI uses
`harness.db` in the repository root.

Set `HARNESS_RUN_ID=<run-id>` during an isolated run to append semantic
operation records to `.harness/changesets/<run-id>.changeset.jsonl` under the
resolved repository root. The first write records a `changeset.header`; durable
write commands append operation records such as `story.update`, `trace.add`,
and `decision.add`. Normal CLI use without `HARNESS_RUN_ID` writes no
changeset.

Requires: the prebuilt Rust CLI at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows.

Direct database inspection may still use SQLite tools, but normal Harness use
should go through the Rust CLI.

### Rust CLI Commands

Current migrated commands:

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli init
scripts/bin/harness-cli migrate
scripts/bin/harness-cli import brownfield
scripts/bin/harness-cli intake ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli story add ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli story update ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli story verify ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli decision add ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli decision verify ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog add ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog close ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli score-trace
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix
scripts/bin/harness-cli query backlog
scripts/bin/harness-cli query decisions
scripts/bin/harness-cli query intakes
scripts/bin/harness-cli query traces
scripts/bin/harness-cli query friction
scripts/bin/harness-cli query stats
scripts/bin/harness-cli query sql ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli db changeset apply ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli db rebuild --from ...
```

`scripts/bin/harness-cli import brownfield` seeds or refreshes the durable database
from existing Harness v0 markdown in `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`,
`docs/decisions/`, and `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`. This keeps already-installed
Harness repos on the Rust CLI path without losing their populated operating
docs.

## Installer

### macOS Homebrew bootstrap

For the short macOS workflow, install the global bootstrap once and initialize
each project from its own directory:

```bash
brew install winterzxzz/tap/harness
harness init
```

The Homebrew Formula pins a versioned macOS kit and SHA-256 checksums. The
global command passes its bundled, verified CLI binary to the local installer;
it does not fetch a payload or executable code during `harness init`.

Use the same Formula on multiple Macs through a Brewfile:

```ruby
tap "winterzxzz/tap"
brew "harness"
```

Run `brew bundle` to apply it, then update in two explicit stages:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade harness
harness update
```

`harness update` reads `.harness/install-state.tsv`, an ignored installer
metadata file. It replaces only files that still match the recorded Harness
hashes, creates new managed files, and leaves local edits untouched. Pass
`--force` to back up then replace a modified managed file. Legacy projects can
run `harness update --adopt` once to record their current Harness files without
overwriting them. A symlinked managed path is refused rather than followed
outside the project.

### Direct installer fallback

The upstream installer applies the Harness v0 operating files and folder
structure to a target project directory. It defaults to the current directory,
accepts a target path, and asks interactive users whether to `1. Merge`,
`2. Override`, or `3. Stop` when the target already contains `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/`, or `scripts/`.
Non-interactive installs stop on those protected paths unless `--merge` or
`--override` is provided. Use `--merge` as the safe update path for repositories
that already have Harness: it keeps existing files in place and creates only
missing Harness files. Add `--refresh-agent-shim` when an older install has the
full generated Harness guide in `AGENTS.md` and should move to the small stable
shim. Use `--override` only when replacing the protected Harness surface is
intentional.

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Yes
```

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --merge --yes
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Merge -Yes
```

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --merge --refresh-agent-shim --yes
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winterzxzz/repository-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Merge -RefreshAgentShim -Yes
```

`--refresh-agent-shim` backs up `AGENTS.md` before changing it. If the existing
file is recognized as the old Harness-generated operating guide, the installer
replaces it with the current shim. Otherwise it appends or replaces only the
marked `<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->` block so project-specific instructions remain
in place.

The installer must stay limited to the reusable Harness operating kit. It
installs agent instructions, policy docs, empty project scaffolds, templates,
schema migrations, and the platform CLI. It does not install the source
repository's root `README.md`, numbered decision history, story packets,
changesets, run artifacts, database, application source folders, package
scripts, CI, tests, platform shells, or fake validation commands.

Installed projects create their own product docs, stories, decisions, traces,
changesets, and run artifacts as work happens. Existing target-owned files are
preserved by `--merge`; removing a path from the source payload is not a cleanup
instruction for already-installed projects.

The stable file payload is declared once in
`scripts/harness-install-files.txt` and is read by both the Bash and PowerShell
installers. Keep reusable Harness policies, empty scaffolds, and templates in
that allowlist. Validate changes with `scripts/validate-install-payload.sh`.
Schema migrations are different: both installers discover
`scripts/schema/*.sql` automatically from the source repository, so adding a
new migration only requires committing the SQL file.

By default the installer also downloads the prebuilt Rust Harness CLI for the
current platform into `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows, then verifies its `.sha256` checksum.
A source branch can pin the release used by the installer through
`scripts/harness-cli-release-tag`. Set `HARNESS_CLI_RELEASE_TAG` to override
that tag, or set `HARNESS_CLI_BASE_URL` to point at an alternate artifact
directory, such as a local `file:///.../dist` directory created by
`scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`.

## Schema Migrations

Migration files live under `scripts/schema/` and are named `NNN-description.sql`
where `NNN` is a zero-padded version number. Run `scripts/bin/harness-cli migrate` to
apply pending migrations.

## Future Command Contract

Expected future checks:

```text
validate:quick
  format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, architecture check

test:integration
  backend contract and integration checks

test:e2e
  user-visible end-to-end flows

test:platform
  platform shell smoke checks, if the project has a native shell

test:release
  full suite, log checks, and performance smoke
```

## Release Packaging

Build the current-platform Rust CLI release artifact from the source repo:

```bash
scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh
```

The script writes `dist/harness-cli-<platform>` plus `.sha256` checksums. The
Windows artifact includes the `.exe` suffix. Supported labels are:

- `macos-arm64`
- `macos-x64`
- `linux-x64`
- `linux-arm64`
- `windows-x64`

For cross-compilation, pass a Cargo target triple:

```bash
scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

GitHub releases are produced by
`.github/workflows/harness-cli-release.yml`. Post-merge maintenance calls this
reusable workflow for the tagged ref; operators can also run it manually with
**Run workflow**. It verifies, builds on native hosted runners, and uploads
these release assets:

- `harness-cli-macos-arm64`
- `harness-cli-macos-arm64.sha256`
- `harness-cli-macos-x64`
- `harness-cli-macos-x64.sha256`
- `harness-cli-linux-x64`
- `harness-cli-linux-x64.sha256`
- `harness-cli-linux-arm64`
- `harness-cli-linux-arm64.sha256`
- `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe`
- `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe.sha256`

Merged PRs are handled by `.github/workflows/post-merge-maintenance.yml`. The
workflow always prepends a PR summary to `CHANGELOG.md`. If the merged PR
changed `crates/harness-cli/`, `scripts/schema/`, Cargo metadata, or
`scripts/build-harness-cli-release.sh`, it also increments the CLI patch
version, updates `scripts/harness-cli-release-tag`, creates a matching
`harness-cli-v*` tag, and calls the reusable Harness CLI release workflow for
the tagged ref.
