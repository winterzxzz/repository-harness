# Execution Plan: Team Time Zones

## Status
Active
## Outcome
Use team-local dates at the task boundary.
## Context
Task status contract and executable status surface.
## Scope
Status calculation only.
## Approach
First contract, then implementation.
## Risks And Recovery
Keep the old calculation recoverable in Git.
## Progress
- [x] Checkpoint 1: product boundary inspected.
- [ ] Checkpoint 2: focused proof recorded.
## Decisions
- Keep task status values unchanged.
## Validation
- Focused proof: pending.
## Result
Pending.
